          <strong>Can you keep sushi overnight?</strong> This is not
          recommended, as the longer you keep the raw fish, you risk bacteria
          growth and illness. If you find that you're getting full and you still
          have ingredients left, you could enjoy the rest of the fish, thinly
          sliced sashimi-style, because that's the most valuable part, and let
          the rest of the ingredients go. Also, refrigerated rice gets hard and
          dry, and doesn't reheat well, so sushi is something that should be
          eaten freshly made.

          <strong>Can you make sushi without fish? </strong>Yes, you can do
          vegetarian and even vegan sushi recipes. There are tons of ideas
          online, but avocado, cucumbers, and carrots are great filler
          ingredients
