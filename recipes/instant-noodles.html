      <li>
        Pour 2 cups of water into a cooking bowl and heat it until it starts
        boiling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer the heat slightly and put the noodle cake into the bowl (and the
        seasoning if it's included with the instant noodles, and if you want
        it).
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the water well so the seasoning gets mixed well. Flip the noodle
        cake to the other side so the seasoning can get mixed with it evenly,
        and repeat the process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir well around every 20 seconds, until the water gets dried off
        completely (typically takes around 2-4 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Your instant noodles is ready. Turn off the heat and put the noodles
        into a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with vegetables and other ingredients of your choice (Personal
        recommendation: pepper, diced chicken and finely chopped tomatoes).
